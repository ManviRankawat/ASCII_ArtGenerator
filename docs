Problem Domain and Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop an ASCII Art Generator that converts digital images into text-based visual representations. ASCII art replaces pixel intensity with characters that have varying densities, where darker areas are mapped to denser characters (such as @ or #) and lighter areas to less dense ones (like , or .). This transformation allows for a creative, low-resolution rendering of images using only textual characters.

The primary inputs of the system are image files (in standard formats such as .jpg, .png, etc.), and the output is a text file containing the ASCII representation of the image. For example, an input could be a photograph of the Mona Lisa, and the output would be a text file with ASCII characters arranged to resemble the painting. This tool is valuable to artists who enjoy creating retro or minimalist artwork, and for developers seeking lightweight visual representations in environments with text-only display constraints, such as command-line interfaces.
